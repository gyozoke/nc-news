NC-News
A functioning news site with articles, comments and user profiles. This reddit-like user interface consumes my NC-News API. Users can view and sort articles, see separate pages for different topics, vote on articles, and post and delete comments on individual articles.

The hosted version of this app can be found here: https://victorncnews.netlify.app
